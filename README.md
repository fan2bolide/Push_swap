# Push_swap

This is the begining of a new 42 project : Push_swap
here you can try it for now by doing make in the repo and ./a.out <args>.
	Example : ./a.out 1 2 3 4 5

You must have multiple args of type int so it can create 2 stacks with those numbers.
Once the project is running you can run multiple commands to handle the stacks a and b together : 

  - pa -> push a -> pushint the uppest value of the stack b to a
  - pb -> same from a to b

  - ra -> rotate a -> rotate the stack a so the first value of a goes to last
  - rb -> same with stack b

  - rra -> reverse rotate a -> rotate the stack a so the last value of a goes to first
  - rrb -> same with stack b
