# Push_swap

This is the begining of a new 42 project : Push_swap
here you can try it for now by doing make in the repo and ./a.out <args>.
	Example : ./push_swap 1 2 3 4 5
That command will give you the instructions to follow to get the stack sorted.

If you're putting less than 10 numbers, it will apply a quick sort for little sizes.

If the number of arguments you give to the program is 10 or greater,
my program will apply a radix sort based on binary digits.
This sorting algorithm is efficient for high number of argument, and is an easy way
to implement a sort based on two stacks with limited instruction set.
